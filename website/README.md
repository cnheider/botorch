## Building

You need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 8.x and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) >= 1.5 in order to build the botorch website.

Switch to the `website` dir from the project root and start the server:
```
cd website
yarn
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (if doesn't automatically open).

Anytime you change the contents of the page, the page should auto-update.

Note that the above does not re-build the API reference (auto-generated by
Sphinx) or parse and embed the tutorial notebooks. If you're looking for a
one-stop shop that does all this, you can run the following:
```
cd scripts
./build.docs.sh
```

## Publishing

The site is hosted as a GitHub page. Once botorch is open to the public,
we will generate a static site and automatically push the output to the
`gh-pages` branch.
